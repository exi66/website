# bdo-sieges

Interactive map for the siege planning stage in Black Desert Online.

## Functionality

Allows you to place various objects on the game map to visualize the siege process, share your map, and also
check the list of guilds that have the opportunity to participate in the Saturday siege.

## Description

Initially, I was just sorting through game packages in search of something interesting and discovered the presence of a
hidden API for getting guild ratings, it was decided to use it to create some kind of thing - and so the interactive
map appeared. The **LeafletJs** library was spied on from another popular resource for the game, where there was already
a map of the game world.
